Lexington commandline tool for screenwriters
============================================

Lexington helps you convert between Final Draft, Fountain and its own lex file formats, and output to PDF, HTML and ebook formats.

At the moment the tool is usable, but not yet complete. Feel free to contribute! The lex input is more complete than the fountain one at the moment, and enables you to create complete screenplays.
